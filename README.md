# Hungry Web App

This web application is all about helping hungry people everywhere. It leverages two external services to help locate people and their cllosest open food sources:

1. Yelp Fusion API - Find restaurants close to the user
2. MapBox - Geocode the user's search location and draw a map showing nearby restaurants.

The application comes with a REST API to handle server requests and a React web front-end that displays a simple user interface for allowing user registration, restaurants search, and favorites.

Information on both can be found in the respective _front-end/_ and _rest-api/_ folders.

Screenshots of the web front-end can be found in the _Screenshots/_ folder.
